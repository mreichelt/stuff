# IntelliJ Tips & Tricks

[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is a wonderful IDE with lots of functions that make developer's lives easier. Here I collect a bunch of random things that I really enjoy to use - and hopefully they will help you as well! ðŸŽ‰

## Tips & Tricks

### How to learn new tricks

The best trick is the one that enables you to learn more tricks! Just press `Shift + Shift`, and you can search for files, settings, functions, classes, actions and so much more! Also this will show you the shortcut for all actions, so it's really nice to learn all those nice shortcuts!

If you're just looking for an action, type `Cmd + Shift + A` on Mac or `Ctrl + Shift + A` on Mac/Linux.

For the rest of this document, I'll only mention the Mac shortcuts for brevity.

### Navigation

- Search files, functions, settings, actions, etc. with `Shift + Shift`
- Jump to line in file e.g. by typing `File:42`
- Jump to class with `Cmd + click`
- Go backward/forward with `Cmd + Alt + Left` or right
- Show/hide tool windows, e.g. `Cmd + 1` for project view

### Editing

- Fix problems and get suggestions with `Alt + Enter`
- Insert new things with `Cmd + N`
- Extend / Shrink selection with `Alt + Up` or `Alt + Down`
- Cut lines with `Cmd + X`
- Duplicate line: `Cmd + D`
- Show parameters `Cmd + P`
- Show help `F1`
- Find usages
- Move lines with `Alt + Shift + Up` or down
- Close other tabs

### Misc

- Copy Maven dependencies (XML) to a Gradle file automatically converts them
- show bytecode
- Analyze data flow to here

### Scratch files
